    "Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate\n",
    "and interact with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request or exchange information.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of where an API is used in real life is in social media platforms. For instance, Twitter provides an API that allows developers\n",
    "to access and interact with Twitter's platform programmatically. Developers can use the Twitter API to retrieve tweets, post new tweets,\n",
    "search for tweets with specific keywords, and perform various other operations. This API enables developers to integrate Twitter \n",
    "functionality into their own applications or build new services that leverage Twitter's data and features."

    "Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "    1.Increased Interoperability: API solutions enable different software systems to communicate with each other, regardless of their \n",
    "    programming language or platform. This enhances the interoperability between systems, allowing for the exchange of data and \n",
    "    functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.Improved Efficiency: API driven infrastructures enable developers to reuse code and functionality from existing software systems, \n",
    "    saving time and reducing the amount of code that needs to be written from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.Better User Experience: APIs can enable third-party developers to create applications that integrate with existing software systems,\n",
    "    providing a better user experience and increased functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.Increased Flexibility: APIs provide developers with greater flexibility, enabling them to choose the best programming languages\n",
    "    and frameworks for their needs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5.New Revenue Streams: APIs can enable companies to create new revenue streams by providing third-party developers with access to \n",
    "    their software systems.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.Security Concerns: API infrastructures can be vulnerable to security breaches, such as SQL injection attacks and cross-site\n",
    "    scripting (XSS) attacks, making it crucial to implement security measures to protect against these threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.Complexity: APIs can be complex, requiring a significant amount of development effort to implement and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.Compatibility Issues: APIs can have compatibility issues between different versions of the same software system or between\n",
    "    different systems, which can lead to errors and system failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.Dependency on Third-Party Developers: APIs rely on third-party developers to create applications that integrate with the \n",
    "    software system. This can create dependencies that are outside of the control of the company that owns the software system.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5.Governance and Management: APIs require proper governance and management to ensure they are being used correctly and consistently \n",
    "    across different applications and systems."

    "1.REST is an architectural style that emphasizes scalability, simplicity, and statelessness in distributed systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.It is based on a client-server model, where clients send requests to servers, and servers respond with requested resources or perform \n",
    "actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.RESTful APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform operations on resources identified by URLs\n",
    "(Uniform Resource Locators).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.REST APIs typically exchange data in lightweight formats like JSON or XML.\n",

    "5.REST is widely used in web development and is known for its simplicity, scalability, and ease of use. It leverages existing HTTP \n",

    "SOAP Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.SOAP defines a set of standards and protocols for message exchange, service description, and service discovery.\n",

    "5.SOAP supports more advanced scenarios like distributed transactions, security, and reliable communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",

    "1.Complexity: SOAP can be more complex to implement and use compared to REST. The XML-based message structure and extensive protocol \n",
    "stack can add overhead and make development and integration more challenging.\n",
